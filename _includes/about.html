                    <p>Stacky Rocks are the musings of Lisa Faiss -- code writer, data science dabbler, and website pixel painter. Her professional background is in software engineering, business analysis, and project management. Since 2009, she's been developing custom websites, themes, and plugins. </p>

                    <p>Her latest obsession is business intelligence. Who couldn't love predictive analytics, machine learning, and data visualization? You got data, but it's not worth squat if you can't quickly and visually tell its story. R and Python are her weapons of choice.  You can catch her at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/businessintelligenceaz/" target="_blank">Business Intelligence Arizona Meetup</a> at least once a month, yammering on with other data junkies.</p>

                    <p>When she's not bent over a computer or wrangling said business intelligence officianados, she's lacing up her hiking boots, treking the deserts, canyons, and mountains of the Southwest. Her advice: follow the Stacky Rocks to stay on the right path. </p>
